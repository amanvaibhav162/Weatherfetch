# 🌤️ Weather Forecast Web App

A simple and clean **Weather Forecast application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to check real-time weather for any city using the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays how long the API took to respond.

This version uses a **separate JavaScript file (`main.js`)** instead of inline JS for cleaner structure and maintainability.
